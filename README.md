# Objective: Deepen and Experiment with Topics on Algorithms

## Statement
We are embarking on a project with two dimensions: research with a comprehensive report and hands-on experimentation. As part of this endeavor, we need to address the following questions. The deliverables will consist of a report containing theoretical aspects and a .zip file housing the experiment codes.

## Questions

1. **The Rabin-Karp Pattern Matching Algorithm**

   The Rabin-Karp algorithm employs a `Hash()` function to locate patterns within a text. However, a conventional `Hash()` function often results in a high complexity of O(m*n), where 'm' is the text size and 'n' is the pattern size. Alternatively, Rabin-Karp proposes a rolling hash or recursive hash function, which calculates the hash of a text window by capitalizing on the previous hash calculation. Please address the following:

   a) Provide an explanation of the proposed hash function used in the Rabin-Karp algorithm.

   b) Present an example of this hash function, elucidate its inner workings, demonstrate how it would be utilized in Rabin-Karp, provide an illustrative example, and perform a complexity analysis.

   c) Implement the Rabin-Karp algorithm using this hash function, test it for the same examples covered in our class exercise, and compare the experimental results.

2. **The Knuth-Morris-Pratt Algorithm**

   The Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm utilizes a preprocessing algorithm for the pattern being sought, based on DFA (Directed Finite Automata), which significantly contributes to its efficiency. Please address the following:

   a) Explain how the standard preprocessing is conducted and its utilization in the KMP algorithm.

   b) Offer an example, perform a complexity analysis.

   c) Implement the KMP algorithm, test it using the same examples employed in the Rabin-Karp exercise, and compare the experimental results.

## Deliverables
The deliverables for this project include:

- A comprehensive report addressing the aforementioned questions.
- The complete source code accompanied by the experimental results.

Feel free to embellish and refine the content further according to your preferences.
